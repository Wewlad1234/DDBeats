# DDBeats
DDBeats is a drum machine that is a continuation of my CMPS 401 project "DDrums" (Renamed since DDrum is an actual company). 
In compliance with the BASS audio library's liscense, this program is freeware. 

Important note: D is a compiled language and I am using a Windows computer. 
Ergo if you are using a Mac/Linux OS, then you will need to recompile the code.

*Libraries used:*

Derelict BASS 

Timer

gtk-D

*Bugs:*

No Bugs detected as of yet!

*To-Do:*

Move from a metronome base into a more drum-like base by incorporating half-notes, quarter notes, etc.

Move to a more drumpad like design instead of the current UI.
